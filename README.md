## Homerun: killswitch for browsers
Not everyone of us gets the privacy they deserve. Because of that, people who live under rather problematic conditions (e.g a person living in a toxic household) can get in great danger if someone finds them looking at something "they're not supposed to".

**Homerun** helps the user to avoid such situations by providing them with a killswitch for all open browser windows. Whenever the user feels endangered, instead of manically clicking "Close" on every browser window, they can just press **Ctrl-Home**. This will close all browser windows, whether they are active or not. 

You can press **Win-Home** to open the program's settings. There, you can select which browsers get closed and which don't, and whether the program displays the "Homerun is up" message whenever it starts.

Currently supported browsers:
-

 - Microsoft Edge (both old and new versions)
 - Google Chrome
 - Mozilla Firefox
 - Opera
